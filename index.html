    <h2>Sample Paragraph - H2 Header</h2>

    <p>Sample paragraph with some interesting text. Did you know that a jellyfish is 95% water? Who knew. Countries such
        as
        Japan consider it a delicacy. This jellyfish fact is the reason behind a growing international market for dried
        jellyfish. The jellyfish is dried to prevent them from spoiling. A jellyfish spoils in a matter of hours if it
        isn't
        dried, while dried jellyfish can be stored for weeks.</p>
